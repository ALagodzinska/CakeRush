# My Personal Project: “Cake Rush” Game

## Description of the project
My project is **a game and a memory exercise** where the user plays as a baker who must **recreate a cake from memory within a time limit**. At the start of each round, the user is shown a randomly generated cake. Once this preview ends, the user has limited time to recreate the image they saw by selecting the correct options from cake elements (number of tiers, color of the cake, glazing color, decorations, etc.). Each element has multiple options to choose from; for example, decorations can include a candle, note, balloon, or flower. If the recreated cake matches the preview cake, the player earns a point and continues to the next round. **The aim is to complete as many rounds as possible.** 

## Who will use the game and why it interests me
This game is great for people who enjoy **time-bound challenges** that **train memory and focus**. It can be played by students to improve their memory skills or simply as a good recreational activity. The reason why I chose this idea is because I want to challenge myself and create a game. As well I plan to draw the cake elements myself and include them in the game to make it more visual. Besides, I enjoy baking, which is why I am excited to create a game about cakes.
